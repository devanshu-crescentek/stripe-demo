          PRICE AND PAYMENT

        <ol className='list-decimal pl-6 mb-[20px]'>
          <li>
            Where to find the price for the product. The price of the products
            will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your
            order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices advised
            to you are correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            What happens if we got the price wrong? It is always possible that,
            despite our best efforts, some of our products may be incorrectly
            priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so
            that, where the correct price at your order date is less than our
            stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If
            the correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated
            to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept
            your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing
            error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been
            recognised by you as a mis-pricing, we may end the contract, refund
            you any sums you have paid.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you must pay and how you must pay. We accept payment via any of
            the methods displayed on the website at the time of your order.
            Unless otherwise agreed between the parties you must pay for the
            services in full upon placing your order.

          OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU
        </h3>
        <ol className='list-decimal pl-6 mb-2'>
          <li>
            We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by
            us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for
            loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our
            breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and
            skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not
            foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious
            that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both
            we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it
            with us during the sales process.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it
            would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or
            personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our
            employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent
            misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to
            our products.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are not liable for business losses. We only supply our products
            for domestic and private use. We will therefore have no liability to
            you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption,
            or loss of business opportunity.

          OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
        </h3>
        <ol className='list-decimal pl-6 mb-[20px]'>
          <li>
            We may transfer this agreement to someone else. We may transfer our
            rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation.
            <ol className='list-decimal pl-6'>
              <li>
                Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is
                between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to
                enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the
                agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or
                make any changes to these terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will
                continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms
                operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides
                that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will
                remain in full force and effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still
                enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do
                anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we
                delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking
                this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do
                those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you
                at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do
                not chase you, but we continue to provide the products, we can
                still require you to make the payment at a later date.

            Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal
            proceedings. These terms are governed by English law and (subject to
            your rights as a consumer to bring proceedings elsewhere) you can
            bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English
            courts.
